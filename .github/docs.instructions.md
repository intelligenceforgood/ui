# UI Repo — Documentation Guidelines

Apply the global docs rules in the root `core` repo and keep UI-specific docs concise.

## Docs rules

- Use headings, bullet lists, and code blocks for examples.
- Use present tense, active voice, and second person (you) for instructions.
- Link to UI-specific files (e.g., `apps/web/` or `docker/`) rather than embedding full files.

## Code Snippets

- Prefer small snippets (<50 lines) highlighting the relevant lines.
- For large config files (Docker, build scripts), show a short excerpt and add a clear link to the full file in the repo.
